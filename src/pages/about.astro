      I created this web app while I was learning astro watching a youtube
      tutorial from midudev where we created the index and the book pages, back
      then the app only had our review of the books. After finishing the
      tutorial I decided to continue working on the project adding more things
      and turning it into a books reviews page for everyone.
      <br />
      <br />
      Now, I´ve always been a fan of reading and been to places like goodreads or
      other review sites that were a little to much for me in terms UX, don´t get
      me wrong they are good sites, I just like simplicty and that´s why I decided
      to create this project to provide just that: An easy way for readers to find
      new books, write reviews and follow their progress as they read through a book.
      <br />
      <br />
      The first version of this site will be quite basic and I will continue to update
      it to provide a more complete app.
      <br />
      <br />
      This is created with so much love and dedication. Feel free to provide feedback
      on what you would like to see on the site, see you soon 😁.
